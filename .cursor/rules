## Markdown Version History Rule

When editing any markdown file (.md), always add or update a version history section at the very bottom of the file after making changes.

### Version History Format

```markdown
---

**Document Version History**

- v1.0 - Initial creation (YYYY-MM-DD)
- v1.1 - Description of changes made (YYYY-MM-DD)
- v1.2 - Description of changes made (YYYY-MM-DD)
```

### Guidelines

1. **Location**: Version history must be at the very end of the markdown file
2. **Format**: Use the exact format shown above with horizontal rule separator
3. **Versioning**: Use semantic versioning (major.minor)  
   - Increment minor version (e.g., 1.1 → 1.2) for content updates, additions, corrections
   - Increment major version (e.g., 1.2 → 2.0) for significant restructuring or complete rewrites
4. **Date Format**: Use YYYY-MM-DD format
5. **Description**: Provide a brief, clear description of what was changed
6. **Existing Files**: If a file already has version history, update it; don't create duplicate sections

### Examples of Version Descriptions

- "Initial creation"
- "Added new section on X"
- "Updated Y section with latest information"
- "Fixed typos and formatting"
- "Restructured document organization"
- "Added examples and clarifications"

### When to Apply

- Any time you edit, create, or modify a markdown file
- Both major content changes and minor edits (typos, formatting)
- When adding new sections or removing existing ones
- When updating existing content for accuracy or clarity
