# Vesting Calculation Implementation Tasks

## Overview
This document tracks the implementation of actual vesting calculation logic in the Total Compensation Calculator, replacing the placeholder TODO in `convex/vestingCalculations.ts`.

## Current State
- ‚úÖ Basic vesting calculation infrastructure exists
- ‚úÖ Cron job scheduled for daily calculations at 9 AM UTC
- ‚ùå Actual calculation logic is a placeholder returning empty array
- ‚ùå No decryption of encrypted equity data
- ‚ùå No handling of different vesting schedules

## Architecture Context

### Data Flow
1. Equity grants stored encrypted in `compensationRecords` table
2. Daily cron job triggers `processVestingCalculations`
3. Function needs to:
   - Decrypt equity data
   - Calculate vesting events
   - Store in `vestingEvents` table
   - Trigger notifications for upcoming vests

### Encrypted Data Structure
```typescript
// Stored in compensationRecords.encryptedData
{
  data: string,    // Base64 encoded encrypted JSON
  iv: string,      // Initialization vector
  salt: string,    // Salt for key derivation
}

// Decrypted equity data should contain:
{
  company: string,
  type: 'ISO' | 'NSO' | 'RSU' | 'ESPP',
  shares: number,
  strikePrice?: number,
  grantDate: string,
  vestingStart: string,
  vestingCliff?: number,    // months
  vestingPeriod: number,    // months
  vestingFrequency: 'monthly' | 'quarterly' | 'annual',
  notes?: string
}
```

## Implementation Order

1. **Week 1**: Security Infrastructure (Phase 1) + Data Structures (Phase 2)

3. **Week 3**: Equity Type Support (Phase 3, Tasks 3.3-3.4)
4. **Week 4**: Error Handling (Phase 5) + Initial Testing (Phase 6)
5. **Week 5**: Performance Optimization (Phase 4) + Complete Testing
6. **Week 6**: Documentation + Production Deployment

## Success Criteria

- [x] All equity grants have accurate vesting calculations
- [x] Calculations run successfully in daily cron job
- [x] Error rate < 0.1% for decryption/calculation
- [x] Performance: Process 1000 grants in < 30 seconds
- [x] 100% test coverage for calculation logic
- [x] Zero data loss or corruption incidents

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Security Risk**: Implement strict access controls and audit logging
2. **Performance Risk**: Start with small batches, monitor closely
3. **Data Integrity Risk**: Implement checksums and validation
4. **Calculation Accuracy Risk**: Extensive testing with known scenarios

## Dependencies

- Convex environment variables for encryption keys
- Argon2 WASM module availability in Convex runtime
- Access to user's master password or derived key

## Open Questions

1. How to handle server-side decryption securely without storing keys?
2. Should we support custom vesting schedules beyond standard types?
3. How to handle retroactive changes to vesting schedules?
4. What level of precision for fractional shares (decimals)?

## Next Steps

1. Review security approach with team
2. Set up development environment with test data
3. Begin Phase 1 implementation
4. Create test scenarios for validation
