# FMV API Integration Tasks

## Overview
This document tracks the implementation of actual FMV (Fair Market Value) API integration to replace the mock data in `convex/fmvUpdates.ts:137`. The goal is to integrate real-time stock price data from multiple providers with fallback support, caching, and proper error handling.

## Current State
- ✅ FMV service exists on frontend with provider implementations
- ✅ Convex mutation for FMV updates with mock data
- ❌ No actual API calls from Convex backend
- ❌ No API key management in environment variables
- ❌ No caching or rate limiting at backend level

## Architecture Overview

### Data Flow
1. Daily cron job triggers `processFMVUpdates` in Convex
2. System identifies companies needing FMV updates
3. Convex action calls external FMV APIs (Yahoo, Alpha Vantage, Finnhub)
4. Results are cached and stored in `fmvHistory` table
5. Notifications generated for significant price changes

### API Providers
- **Yahoo Finance** (Free, no auth required, 100 req/min)
- **Alpha Vantage** (Free tier: 5 req/min, 500/day)
- **Finnhub** (Free tier: 60 req/min, 1000/day)

## Implementation Tasks

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup (High Priority)

#### Task 1.1: Environment Variable Configuration ✅
- [x] Add FMV API keys to `.env.example`:
  ```
  # FMV API Configuration
  ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY=your_alpha_vantage_key
  FINNHUB_API_KEY=your_finnhub_key
  FMV_DEFAULT_PROVIDER=yahoo
  FMV_ENABLE_FALLBACK=true
  ```
- [ ] Update deployment documentation for API key setup
- [ ] Add API keys to Vercel environment variables
- [ ] Configure Convex environment variables

#### Task 1.2: Create Convex Actions Directory Structure ✅
- [x] Create `convex/actions/` directory
- [x] Create `convex/actions/fmvApi.ts` for API calls
- [x] Create `convex/lib/fmvCache.ts` for caching logic
- [x] Create `convex/lib/fmvRateLimit.ts` for rate limiting

### Phase 2: Convex Action Implementation (Critical)

#### Task 2.1: Create FMV API Action ✅
- [x] Create `convex/actions/fmvApi.ts` with:
  ```typescript
  // Core function to fetch FMV with fallback
  export const fetchFMV = action({
    args: {
      ticker: v.string(),
      provider: v.optional(v.string()),
    },
    handler: async (ctx, args) => {
      // Implementation here
    }
  });
  ```
- [x] Implement provider-specific methods:
  - [x] `fetchFromYahoo(ticker: string)`
  - [x] `fetchFromAlphaVantage(ticker: string, apiKey: string)`
  - [x] `fetchFromFinnhub(ticker: string, apiKey: string)`
- [x] Add fallback logic between providers
- [x] Implement error handling and logging

#### Task 2.2: Implement Rate Limiting ✅
- [x] Create rate limiter using Convex's storage
- [x] Track API calls per provider
- [x] Implement backoff strategy
- [x] Add circuit breaker for failing providers

#### Task 2.3: Update FMV Updates Mutation ✅
- [x] Replace `simulateFMVAPICall` in `fmvUpdates.ts`
- [x] Call new FMV action instead of mock
- [x] Add proper error handling
- [x] Log API call results

### Phase 3: Caching & Optimization (High Priority)

#### Task 3.1: Implement Caching Layer ✅
- [x] Create cache table or use existing storage
- [x] Cache FMV results with TTL (5 minutes for market hours, 1 hour for closed)
- [x] Implement cache key generation (ticker + timestamp)
- [x] Add cache warming for popular tickers

#### Task 3.2: Batch Processing Optimization ✅
- [x] Group API calls by provider
- [x] Implement parallel processing where allowed
- [x] Add progress tracking for large batches
- [ ] Optimize database writes

#### Task 3.3: Cost Optimization
- [x] Prioritize free providers (Yahoo) for common stocks
- [x] Use paid providers only for fallback or specific needs
- [ ] Track API usage costs
- [ ] Implement usage alerts

### Phase 4: Private Company Support (Medium Priority)

#### Task 4.1: Private Company Valuation Logic
- [ ] Add estimation algorithm for private companies
- [ ] Support manual FMV entry with approval
- [ ] Track confidence scores for estimates
- [ ] Implement valuation history

#### Task 4.2: Manual Override System
- [ ] Add UI for manual FMV updates
- [ ] Implement approval workflow
- [ ] Track override reasons
- [ ] Add audit logging

### Phase 5: Monitoring & Alerting (High Priority)

#### Task 5.1: API Health Monitoring
- [ ] Track success/failure rates per provider
- [ ] Monitor response times
- [ ] Alert on provider outages
- [ ] Track rate limit usage

#### Task 5.2: Data Quality Monitoring
- [ ] Validate FMV data ranges
- [ ] Alert on suspicious price movements
- [ ] Track data staleness
- [ ] Monitor confidence scores

#### Task 5.3: Cost Monitoring
- [ ] Track API calls per provider
- [ ] Calculate monthly costs
- [ ] Alert on cost overruns
- [ ] Generate usage reports

### Phase 6: Testing & Validation (Critical)

#### Task 6.1: Unit Tests
- [ ] Test each provider integration
- [ ] Test fallback scenarios
- [ ] Test rate limiting
- [ ] Test caching behavior

#### Task 6.2: Integration Tests
- [ ] Test full cron job flow
- [ ] Test error recovery
- [ ] Test notification generation
- [ ] Test batch processing

#### Task 6.3: Load Testing
- [ ] Test with 1000+ companies
- [ ] Measure API call efficiency
- [ ] Test rate limit handling
- [ ] Verify cache effectiveness

### Phase 7: Documentation & Deployment (Low Priority)

#### Task 7.1: API Setup Documentation
- [ ] Document API key acquisition process
- [ ] Create provider comparison guide
- [ ] Document cost considerations
- [ ] Add troubleshooting guide

#### Task 7.2: Operational Documentation
- [ ] Create monitoring playbook
- [ ] Document manual intervention procedures
- [ ] Add API failure runbooks
- [ ] Create cost optimization guide

## Implementation Order

1. **Week 1**: Environment setup + Basic API action implementation
2. **Week 2**: Replace mock with real APIs + Rate limiting
3. **Week 3**: Caching + Monitoring implementation
4. **Week 4**: Testing + Documentation + Production deployment

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All public company FMVs update from real APIs daily
- [ ] API failures handled gracefully with fallback
- [ ] Rate limits respected for all providers
- [ ] Cache reduces API calls by >50%
- [ ] Monitoring alerts on failures
- [ ] Cost stays within budget (<$50/month)

## Risk Mitigation

1. **API Key Security**: Store in environment variables, never in code
2. **Rate Limit Violations**: Implement strict rate limiting with buffer
3. **Provider Outages**: Multiple fallback providers configured
4. **Cost Overruns**: Daily cost monitoring and alerts
5. **Data Quality**: Validation and anomaly detection

## Dependencies

- Convex HTTP actions support
- Environment variable configuration in Vercel
- API keys from providers (Alpha Vantage, Finnhub)

## Open Questions

1. Should we support more providers (IEX Cloud, Polygon.io)?
2. How to handle stock splits and corporate actions?
3. Should we store historical FMV data for trends?
4. What's the budget for API costs?

## Next Steps

1. Obtain API keys from providers
2. Set up environment variables
3. Create Convex action structure
4. Begin Phase 1 implementation
