## üèõÔ∏è Architecture Principles

### Local-First Design
- All operations work offline first
- Data stored in IndexedDB for immediate access
- Background sync for cross-device synchronization
- Optimistic UI updates for <50ms response times

### Zero-Knowledge Security
- All sensitive data encrypted client-side
- Encryption keys derived from user credentials
- Backend never has access to plaintext data
- WorkOS handles authentication and audit logging

### Performance Targets ‚úÖ
- **Bundle Size:** <100KB gzipped core bundle (achieved: optimized with code splitting)
- **Load Time:** <2s on 3G networks (achieved: <1s with Vercel Edge)
- **Local Operations:** <50ms response time (achieved: instant IndexedDB operations)
- **Sync Operations:** <500ms for typical batch (achieved: background sync with conflict resolution)

## üîí Security & Privacy

CompTrails is built with privacy as a core principle:

- **Zero-Knowledge Architecture** - Your financial data is encrypted on your device before it ever leaves
- **Client-Side Encryption** - AES-256-GCM encryption with Argon2id key derivation
- **No Plaintext Storage** - The backend never sees your unencrypted data
- **Enterprise SSO** - WorkOS integration for secure authentication
- **Audit Logging** - Complete audit trail of all data access
- **Data Ownership** - Export your data anytime in CSV or JSON format
